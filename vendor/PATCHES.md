| License | MIT-0 (`LICENSE` in the vendored folder) |
| Import method | `git -c core.autocrlf=false archive` of that commit, so files keep LF endings |
| Import check | all 50 files hashed with `git hash-object --no-filters`: 50/50 equal to the upstream blobs |
| Unmodified import | commit `d73fc39` on this repo, so `git diff d73fc39 -- vendor/` shows every local change |

`.gitattributes` sets `vendor/** -text` so a Windows checkout does not convert these files to CRLF. `deploy.sh` and `preflight.sh` do not run under bash with CRLF.

## Patches

P1-P3 keep upstream behaviour when their new input is empty. P4 changes upstream behaviour unconditionally (decision D9 in `design.md`). Every inserted block is marked `PATCH P<n> (kiro-enterprise-monitoring)`.

### P1. Report written by another account

- `cfn/01-data-layer.yaml`: new parameter `SourceAccountId` (default `""`, pattern `^$|^[0-9]{12}$`), new condition `HasSourceAccount` added to the existing `Conditions` block, and `RAW_PREFIX` uses `SourceAccountId` when set, else `AWS::AccountId`.
- `scripts/deploy.sh`: reads `KIRO_SOURCE_ACCOUNT_ID` (default `""`), passes `SourceAccountId=${KIRO_SOURCE_ACCOUNT_ID}` in both data-stack `--parameter-overrides` blocks, and `probe_prefix` uses `${KIRO_SOURCE_ACCOUNT_ID:-$ACCOUNT_ID}`. Header comment documents the variable.

### P2. Preflight when the report bucket is in another account

- `scripts/preflight.sh`: reads `KIRO_SOURCE_ACCOUNT_ID`. When it is set and differs from the caller account, step 5 prints a `WARN` and does not list the bucket. The person deploying has no list permission on the customer bucket by design; the normalizer invoke result after deploy is the real check. Otherwise step 5 is unchanged, including its `FAIL`.

### P3. ExternalId for the Identity Center role

- `scripts/identity_map_lambda.py`: `_idc_client` adds `ExternalId` to `sts.assume_role` only when `IDC_EXTERNAL_ID` is non-blank. Docstring documents the variable.
- `cfn/03-identity-mapping.yaml`: new parameter `IdcExternalId` (default `""`) wired to the Lambda environment as `IDC_EXTERNAL_ID`.
- `scripts/deploy.sh`: reads `IDC_EXTERNAL_ID` (default `""`) and passes `IdcExternalId=${IDC_EXTERNAL_ID}` to the identity-map stack.

### P4. No KMS key for the identity map

Added 2026-10-29. The operator chose SSE-S3 for every bucket this project creates (D9), to drop the per-customer key fee.

- `cfn/03-identity-mapping.yaml`: `IdentityMapKey` (`AWS::KMS::Key`, `DeletionPolicy: Retain`) and `IdentityMapKeyAlias` removed. `IdentityMapBucket` uses `SSEAlgorithm: AES256` without `BucketKeyEnabled`. The Lambda role's `KmsForIdentityMap` policy and the `IdentityMapKeyArn` output removed. Access logging, versioning, the TLS-only bucket policy and Block Public Access are unchanged.
- `scripts/deploy.sh`: no longer reads `IdentityMapKeyArn`, and no longer passes `--kms-key-arn` to `grant_quicksight_s3.py`. QuickSight still gets `read` on the identity-map bucket.
- `scripts/teardown.sh`: the "identity-map KMS key is retained" note removed.
- Not changed: `SourceKmsKeyArn` and `KMS_KEY_ARN`, the optional pass-through for a key the customer owns on the report bucket. This project requires that bucket to be SSE-S3, so the value stays empty.
- Not changed: upstream `README.md` and `SECURITY.md` still describe the dedicated CMK. For this repo, this section replaces those statements.
- Trade-off: anyone with `s3:GetObject` on the identity-map bucket can read names and emails. There is no second `kms:Decrypt` check and no CloudTrail record of key use per read.

## Tests

`tests/test_crossaccount_patches.py` has 13 tests for P1-P3. Each patch is tested with its new input both set and empty. `tests/test_no_kms_patch.py` has 7 tests for P4.

| Run | Ran | Pass | Error | Skipped |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| Upstream, before patching | 145 | 134 | 10 | 1 |
| After P1-P3 | 158 | 147 | 10 | 1 |
| After P1-P4 | 165 | 154 | 10 | 1 |

- The 10 errors are the same in both runs, all in `test_versioning.TestTagMerge`. That test starts `bash` through Python `subprocess`, which on this Windows machine resolves to the WSL launcher in System32 instead of Git Bash and fails with a WSL RPC error. They do not touch any patched code path.
- Against the five upstream files restored byte-exact, 9 of the 13 new tests fail. The 4 that pass on upstream guard upstream behaviour that must survive (one `Conditions` block, the same-account `FAIL`, no `ExternalId` when the variable is empty or unset).
- P4: against the three upstream files restored byte-exact, all 7 P4 tests fail.
- `cfn-lint` 1.52.0 on all three templates: 0 findings before and after, including after P4.
- `bash -n` on `deploy.sh`, `preflight.sh` and `teardown.sh`: 0 errors after patching.
- `preflight.sh` run under Git Bash with a stub `aws` CLI: cross-account prints `[WARN] report bucket belongs to account ...` and makes 0 list calls on the bucket; same-account still prints `[FAIL] user_report not found` after 1 list call.

## Remaining account-pinned paths

`grep AWSLogs` over `cfn/`, `scripts/` and `athena/` (tests excluded):

- `cfn/01-data-layer.yaml`: `RAW_PREFIX` (patched) and two parameter descriptions.
- `scripts/deploy.sh`: `probe_prefix` (patched) and a comment.
- `scripts/preflight.sh` lines 169 and 213: still use the caller account, but only on the same-account branch that P2 leaves unchanged.

## Upgrading the sample

Export the new upstream commit the same way, re-apply P1-P4 by searching for the `PATCH P<n>` markers, re-run the test suite, and update the tables above.
